# Termisu shell integration: OSC 133 semantic marks (FinalTerm / semantic-prompt scheme).
#
# Four marks drive blocks:
#   A  prompt starts        (rides the front of PS1)
#   B  input starts         (rides the end of PS1)
#   C  output starts        (preexec)
#   D  command finished     (next precmd, with the exit status when a command ran)
#
# The naive shape -- append B to PROMPT from a hook registered at .zshenv time -- dies
# under any theme whose own precmd regenerates PROMPT after ours: registration order is
# load order, .zshenv loads before .zshrc, so the theme always wins and the input mark
# silently disappears (measured live under starship's transient-prompt restore,
# 2026-07-30; pinned by crates/host/tests/shell_integration.rs). The shape that survives
# is the one the oracle's own integration uses (../ruuah/src/shell-integration/zsh, MIT):
#
#   1. defer real registration to the FIRST precmd, which runs after the user's rc;
#   2. keep our precmd LAST in precmd_functions, re-sorting every cycle it is displaced;
#   3. re-mark whatever PS1 the theme just produced instead of fighting it, restoring
#      the saved clean copy first so marks never stack.
#
# This file also emits OSC 7 (the working directory), because NOTHING ELSE DOES in our
# windows: macOS defines update_terminal_cwd in /etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal and /etc/zshrc
# sources that file only when $TERM_PROGRAM is Apple_Terminal, which we never set
# (verified 2026-07-31). The host keys command history by it, so a shell without this
# integration simply gets the global history it always had.
#
# Not covered yet: PS2 continuation marks, and the zle-invoked-precmd edge Ghostty's
# cl=line option exists for. Both are documented gaps, not oversights.
