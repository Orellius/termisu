//! Purpose: own a pseudoterminal and a child process, and turn their output into frames.
//! Public surface: `Host`, `Options`, `Geometry`, `SpawnError`.
//! Why this file: this is the only place in the project that performs I/O, which is what
//!   lets the core stay a pure state machine. The `Terminal` itself lives on the pump thread
//!   and is never shared -- the thread boundary is crossed by published frames alone, so
//!   there is nothing to lock and no way for a renderer to observe a half-parsed sequence.
//! NOT responsible for: parsing (`termisu-vt-core`), the frame handoff (`termisu-vt-frame`), or
//!   drawing anything.
//! Test strategy: `tests/child.rs` runs real programs on a real pty and asserts the frame a
//!   renderer would draw, including that the pty is a controlling terminal (a child that
//!   cannot open /dev/tty is the failure this would otherwise hide) and that a resize
//!   reaches the child as SIGWINCH.
