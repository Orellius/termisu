//! The generated Linux keycode table, and the invariant that makes a per-platform key source
//! survivable at all.
//!
//! The maintainer's call on 2026-08-08 was a NATIVE key source per platform: `NSEvent` on macOS, GTK's
//! `key-press-event` on Linux, and a third one on Windows later. The named risk of that route,
//! in his own words, is two tables that must never disagree - and a disagreement between them
//! is per-key and silent, which is the worst shape a defect can have here. One key stops
//! working on one platform and nothing errors, nothing logs, and no other test moves.
//!
//! Two things make it survivable, and this file is the second one:
//!
//! 1. **One generator.** `scripts/gen-keymap.ts` emits both tables from the SAME rows of
//!    Chromium's `dom_code_data` - a platform is a column index and a sentinel, nothing more.
//!    Two tables generated from one row cannot disagree about which physical key a DomCode is.
//! 2. **A test that reads the generated comments.** The tables carry their DomCode in a trailing
//!    comment, so the agreement in (1) is checkable at test time rather than promised by the
//!    shape of a script nobody runs.
//!
//! NOT gated on `target_os`: both tables are data, and a table that can only be tested on the
//! machine it targets is a table that never gets tested. This file runs on the developer's Mac
//! and on the Linux CI job alike.
//!
//! What this file CANNOT prove, said out loud rather than left to be discovered as "one key does
//! nothing": that GTK's `GdkEventKey.hardware_keycode` is in fact the X11/xkb keycode this table
//! is keyed on. GDK documents the field only as "the raw code of the key that was pressed or
//! released" (docs.gtk.org, read 2026-08-08) and names no convention. The table is right about
//! Chromium; whether it is right about GTK is a live tap on a real Linux machine.
