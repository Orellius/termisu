//! The generated macOS keycode table.
//!
//! WHAT THIS FILE USED TO DO, and why saying so matters. Until 2026-08-08 it read
//! `swift/Sources/termisu-host/KeyMap.swift` at test time and demanded exact agreement with the
//! Rust table. `scripts/gen-keymap.ts` wrote both from one source, and two generated copies are
//! safe only while they are actually regenerated together - the moment somebody hand-edits one,
//! or regenerates against a moved oracle and commits only the file their build touched, the two
//! hosts disagree about what a key IS. That failure is per-key and silent.
//!
//! The Swift host was retired in T6, so that test had nothing left to compare against and is
//! gone. **The property it guarded is NOT gone**: `keycode_linux.rs` makes the same check
//! between the macOS and Linux tables, by parsing the DomCode each entry carries in its
//! generated comment. It is a better version of the same test, because both sides now live in
//! this repository and neither can be edited without the other being visible in the same diff.
//!
//! What is genuinely lost is narrower and worth naming: nothing now proves the table is usable
//! from a language that is not Rust. That was never what this test measured, but the Swift file
//! existing was incidental evidence of it.
