//! Five encoder properties rescued from the Tauri host's key adapter before it was deleted.
//!
//! They lived in `crates/termisu/src/keys.rs`, whose job was translating `tao`'s `KeyEvent` into
//! this crate's. Eight tests were in that file; three were genuinely about tao and GDK and died
//! with it. These five never touched tao at all - they build a `KeyEvent` by hand and assert what
//! the ENCODER does with it. They were in that file because that is where somebody happened to be
//! working, and deleting the host would have taken them with it silently.
//!
//! Checked before the move rather than assumed: no equivalent exists in `key.rs`'s own tests or
//! in `keycode.rs`/`keycode_linux.rs`. Dropping them would have been a real regression hidden
//! inside a deletion whose diff nobody would read line by line.
