//! Backspace, end to end: the key event in, the erased line out.
//!
//! The maintainer, 2026-08-11: "why using backspace is literally spacing the text?" That symptom has a
//! specific shape. A shell erases the character under the cursor by sending `\b \b` - move left,
//! overwrite with a space, move left again - so a terminal that gets the LAST `\b` wrong leaves
//! the space it just wrote sitting where the character was. "Spacing the text" is exactly what a
//! broken `\b \b` looks like, and it is invisible to any test that only checks the encoder.
//!
//! So this drives the whole chain rather than the table: `termisu_host_key` -> the encoder ->
//! a real pty -> a real zsh's line editor -> the core -> the grid. Every layer in between has
//! its own unit tests and all of them pass, which is why the defect was reported from a screen
//! and not from a suite.
//!
//! It lives in `crates/host` because both hosts share this path. The Swift host maps macOS
//! keyCode 51 to key id 53 in `KeyMap.swift`, and `Key::ALL` is in declaration order, so id 53
//! is `Key::Backspace` for the Tauri host too. One gate covers both.
