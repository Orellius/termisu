//! The Rust-native `Session` entry, proven at the level the C surface is proven at: PIXELS.
//!
//! The blind spot this closes is total. `Session::poll` returns a bool, and a session that
//! never advances, a renderer that draws nothing, and a child that produced no output are
//! indistinguishable from each other through that bool - all three simply keep returning
//! `false`, which is also what a perfectly healthy quiet terminal returns.
//!
//! So the assertion is on the drawn buffer, and it is two-directional in the same file: a child
//! that PRINTS must put ink on the surface, and a child that prints NOTHING must not. The
//! second is the control. Without it, "there is more than one colour here" would pass on a
//! renderer that painted a stripe of garbage, and would keep passing if the child were never
//! spawned at all.
