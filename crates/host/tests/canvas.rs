//! Two real shells in one canvas, each asked what size IT thinks it is.
//!
//! The defect this file exists to catch is the one that looks healthy: a pane whose pty kept the
//! whole window's column count. Its terminal renders perfectly, its colours are right, and its
//! right-hand columns are drawn underneath the neighbour - so a command's output is silently
//! truncated at the seam and it reads as a program that stopped mid-line.
//!
//! Deriving the expected columns in Rust and comparing against the session's own geometry would
//! pass on exactly that bug, because both sides would be the same wrong number. So the number
//! comes back through the pseudoterminal: each child runs `stty size` and we read the answer off
//! its own grid. That is the whole seam - layout arithmetic, `TIOCSWINSZ`, the child's idea of
//! itself, the parser, and the renderer - in one assertion per pane.
