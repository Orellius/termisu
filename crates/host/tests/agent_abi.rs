//! The agent surface, driven through the C ABI rather than through Rust.
//!
//! `agent.rs` has been correct and unreachable since 2026-08-11: zero exports, so the shipped
//! app could not launch an agent into a pane at all. Its own unit tests prove the registry and
//! the guard as Rust; they cannot prove that an embedder can reach either, which is the whole
//! defect this file closes. Everything here goes through the same entry points Swift calls.
//!
//! The launch tests shadow a registry binary on `PATH` with a fake rather than starting a real
//! agent. That is not a weaker test - it is a STRONGER one, and it is the only version that can
//! run in an automated suite at all: `launch.rs`'s real-agent test is `#[ignore]`d precisely
//! because a suite must not start authenticated agent processes on someone's machine every run.
//! A fake on `PATH` still exercises registry lookup, the `PATH` walk, the exec-bit check,
//! `launch::dress`, the pty, the pump and the renderer - everything except the vendor's own
//! binary, which is not ours to test.
