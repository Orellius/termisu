//! Every spawn path hands its child the same environment.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a defect report rather than a precaution. On 2026-08-08 a real
//! `claude` launched into a pane reported:
//!
//!     Transcript saving is off - inherited CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION marker
//!
//! The rule that prevents exactly that had existed since slice 8 and was correct. It just lived
//! inside `main.rs`'s `shell_from`, and three other places built a `Command` without it:
//! `launch::shell_command`, `agent::launch`, and the probe host. Nothing compared them, so the
//! divergence was invisible - the same shape that had already cost this project `font-family`
//! and `font-ligatures`, which were parsed and then applied on one path only.
//!
//! The fix is one function, `launch::dress`. This file is what keeps it one function: it asserts
//! the ENVIRONMENT MUTATIONS a built `Command` carries, without spawning anything. A test that
//! spawned would need a pty, a real shell and a login profile, and would then be measuring the
//! machine rather than the code.
//!
//! What this canNOT see, stated so the coverage is not overclaimed: whether the child actually
//! ends up with these values. Inheritance, profile scripts and the pty are all downstream of
//! here. `scripts/smoke-termisu.sh` covers that end, by launching the host with a poisoned
//! environment and reading the values back off the grid.
