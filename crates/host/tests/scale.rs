//! How many panes this host can actually hold, measured rather than assumed.
//!
//! Everything in this project has run at one or two panes. The canvas slice exists because the
//! operator runs FORTY-ONE agent sessions at once, so "does it scale" stopped being a curiosity
//! and became the assumption every canvas design rests on. An assumption nobody has executed is
//! the thing this repo has been bitten by ten slices running.
//!
//! Three costs are separable and only one of them is obvious:
//!
//! - **The pty.** One child, one master fd, one pump thread each. The known hazard is fd
//!   exhaustion and the transient ENXIO the pty host retries three times over 25ms - a retry
//!   budget sized for ONE terminal opening, not for N opening in a tight loop.
//! - **The GPU surface.** Every pane owns a pixel buffer and its bind group. They share one
//!   device by design (a composited frame is one render pass), so the ceiling here is memory and
//!   the backend's own limits, not the device count.
//! - **The frame.** Each pane publishes through its own seqlock, so nothing serialises across
//!   panes; what does serialise is the single present.
//!
//! IGNORED BY DEFAULT. It spawns dozens of real children and is a measurement, not an invariant -
//! a number that moves with the machine's load has no business failing anyone's commit. Run it
//! deliberately:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p termisu --test scale -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
