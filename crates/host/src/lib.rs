//! Purpose: the embedder C surface -- spawn a shell, poll rendered pixels, send bytes.
//! Public surface: `termisu_host_spawn/poll/send/resize/free` and their C types, mirrored
//!   one-to-one by `include/termisu_host.h`.
//! Why this file: the GUI host (slice 8's Swift app) needs the pty -> core -> frame ->
//!   renderer pipeline behind one C handle, and none of that belongs in the `ghostty_*`
//!   mirror, which stays a pure VT readout. Depending on `termisu-vt-abi` as an rlib puts
//!   both surfaces in one archive, because two Rust staticlibs cannot share a link.
//! NOT responsible for: VT semantics (core), the handoff protocol (frame), I/O (pty),
//!   rasterization (render). This crate only composes them and polices the boundary.
//! Test strategy: `tests/host_abi.rs` drives the whole chain through the C surface and
//!   byte-compares the pixels against a reference renderer fed the identical bytes through
//!   the Rust API, using the same `Publisher` the pump uses -- plus the skip-a-row control
//!   that proves the comparison can fail.

// The rlib dependency is what carries the 13 `ghostty_*` exports into this staticlib.

// UI builds its own argv in Swift is a policy with a hole in it. So the embedder gets the
// registry as DATA (`count`/`info`), the machine's answer about what is installed
// (`resolve`), the guard as a QUESTION it can ask before it even enables a button
// (`screen`), and a spawn that asks the guard again itself (`spawn_agent`) -- because a check
// the caller may forget is not a guard.
