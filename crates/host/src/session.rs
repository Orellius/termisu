//! Purpose: the RUST-native composition of pty -> core -> frame -> renderer -> window, for
//!   embedders that live in this workspace.
//! Public surface: `Session`, `SessionGeometry`, `SessionError`.
//! Why this file: `lib.rs` composes the same pieces behind the C ABI, and that surface exists
//!   for the Swift host and for outside embedders. Termisu is neither - it is a Rust program in
//!   this workspace, and crossing a foreign-function boundary to reach its own crates would buy
//!   nothing and cost the type system. So the composition is offered twice, once per audience.
//! NOT responsible for: policy. It does not decide which shell to run, what the font is called
//!   or how big the window should be - the caller builds the `Command` and states the geometry.
//!   Also not responsible yet for kitty image placements, unicode placeholders or row
//!   semantics; the C path draws those and this one does not. **That gap is deliberate and
//!   recorded**: it is the convergence debt of having two compositions, and it closes when the
//!   Swift host retires (B7) and `lib.rs` delegates here rather than duplicating.
//! Test strategy: `tests/session.rs` spawns a real child through this type and asserts the
//!   rendered pixels change once the child has written - with the control that makes the
//!   assertion falsifiable, a session polled before any output must NOT satisfy it.
