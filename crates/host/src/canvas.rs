//! Purpose: N sessions in one area - the panes a wizard-declared canvas actually contains.
//! Public surface: `Canvas` (the live one), `PaneSpec`, `CanvasError`.
//! Why this file: `layout::Canvas` says where the rectangles ARE; this says what is inside them
//!   and, above all, that each pane's pty was told ITS OWN size. That is the silent failure the
//!   whole slice exists to prevent: a pane that keeps the full window's column count draws a
//!   perfectly healthy terminal whose right-hand columns land underneath its neighbour. Nothing
//!   errors, nothing looks broken, and the child is confidently writing into pixels nobody can
//!   see - which reads as an agent that stopped half way through a line.
//! NOT responsible for: windows, swapchains or input. The host owns those; this owns the panes
//!   and their geometry, so it can be tested with real shells and no screen at all.
//! Test strategy: the pty is asked what size it thinks it is, by the CHILD, with `stty size`.
//!   Deriving cols in Rust and asserting Rust's own arithmetic would pass on exactly the bug
//!   being hunted - the number has to come back from the other side of the pseudoterminal.
