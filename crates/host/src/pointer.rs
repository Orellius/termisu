//! Purpose: the host side of mouse reporting - geometry, held buttons, motion dedup, and the
//!   routing decision a wheel needs.
//! Public surface (crate): `Pointer`, `Wheel`.
//! Why this file: the ENCODER is pure and lives in `termisu_vt_pty::mouse`, measured byte for byte
//!   against the oracle. What it cannot own is the state around it - which buttons the operator
//!   is holding, which cell was last reported, how big the view is - and that state has to live
//!   in the host. It lived in the C ABI only, so a Rust host wanting mouse support had two
//!   choices: reach through a foreign-function boundary into its own workspace, or write the
//!   policy a second time. A second policy is the worse one: the Swift host is the ORACLE for
//!   the Tauri port, and two implementations make "do the two hosts agree?" a question about
//!   the hosts rather than about the port.
//! NOT responsible for: the encoding (the pty crate), reading events (each host's window layer),
//!   or scrolling the viewport - `Wheel::Viewport` hands that decision back to the caller
//!   precisely because it is host policy, not protocol.
//! Test strategy: the five end-to-end mouse tests in `tests/host_abi.rs` drive real children
//!   through the C surface and were written before this file existed; they are what proves the
//!   extraction changed nothing. `tests/session.rs` proves the same paths through the Rust
//!   surface, so both callers are covered by tests that share no code.

        // The maintainer: "why not make it intuitive like ghostty? just scroll up and scroll down? shift +
        // something is bad UX execution." He is right, and finding out WHY plain scrolling did
        // nothing took three measurements that are worth keeping:
        //
        //  1. A real Claude Code enables 1000, 1002, 1003 and 1006 - full mouse reporting with
        //     SGR - read straight off the wire.
        //  2. Delivered a wheel report, it does NOTHING: `Session::wheel` returned true and the
        //     grid came back byte-identical.
        //  3. Scrolling our own viewport instead also does nothing, because it lives on the
        //     ALTERNATE SCREEN, and the alternate screen has no scrollback by protocol.
        //
        // So both obvious policies - "the child owns the wheel" and "the operator owns the
        // wheel" - move nothing at all in the one application this terminal exists to run. What
        // moves is ALTERNATE SCROLL: the wheel becomes arrow keys, which a list-shaped TUI acts
        // on. That is why scrolling feels natural in other terminals, and it is the whole reason
        // the branch order below changed.
        //
        // REVISED 2026-10-02 against Claude Code 2.1.287, which DOES act on wheel reports now:
        // it scrolls its transcript on an SGR wheel report and answers arrow-ups with nothing
        // (15 reports redrew 9128 bytes, 15 arrows drew 0). Arrows-first had made a long
        // conversation unscrollable, so the order is back to xterm's and Ghostty's.
        //
        // The order, and every line of it is load-bearing:
        //   shift          -> the operator's viewport, always. The escape hatch, for reaching
        //                     scrollback from inside a program that owns the mouse.
        //   reporting      -> the child's report, on either screen. A program that asked for
        //                     the mouse gets the wheel.
        //   alternate scr. -> arrow keys, for a full-screen program that did NOT ask for the
        //                     mouse (a pager, `less`), which is what alternate scroll is for.
