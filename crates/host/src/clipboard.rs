//! Purpose: the clipboard path in both directions - bytes to the child, and a selection out.
//! Public surface: `paste`, `paste_text`, `text`, `set_text`.
//! Why this file: both hosts paste, and this was written twice before it was written once. The
//!   split between the two functions here is the load-bearing part: `paste_text` takes the text
//!   as an ARGUMENT, so a gate can exercise the whole encode-and-send path with a fixture and
//!   never read - let alone disturb - the operator's real clipboard. Reading the pasteboard is
//!   the one line that cannot be tested headlessly, and it is now the only one.
//! NOT responsible for: the paste TRANSFORM. `termisu_vt_pty::paste::encode` owns it and is
//!   measured byte-for-byte against `ghostty_paste_encode`; a second cleaning pass here would
//!   be a second implementation of a rule that already has an oracle.
//! Test strategy: `paste_text` is proven end to end by the Termisu smoke (a fixture is sent and
//!   must appear on the grid); `text` is a live-tap item by construction.

/// insufficient" - it is not.** `gtk` entered the tree for the key source in T2b and it carries
/// the system clipboard, so reaching for `arboard` or `copypasta` would add a package to do what
/// the toolkit under our own window already does, with its own idea of which display connection
/// to use. GTK's clipboard talks to the same GDK display the window lives on; a third-party
/// crate opens its own, which is a second connection to disagree with the first.
///
/// **`SELECTION_CLIPBOARD`, never `SELECTION_PRIMARY`.** X11 has two, and PRIMARY is the
/// middle-click selection every text widget writes to as you drag. Writing there would replace
/// whatever the operator last highlighted anywhere on their desktop, every time a Termisu
/// selection changed. CLIPBOARD is the one ctrl+c means.
///
/// **The X11 caveat, stated rather than discovered**: an X11 clipboard is owned by the process
/// that set it, so what we put there vanishes when Termisu exits unless a clipboard manager is
/// running. `store()` asks the manager to keep it and is a no-op when there is none - which is
/// why it is called rather than assumed, and why this cannot promise more than it does.
