//! Purpose: which key chords move the scrollback viewport, and by how much.
//! Public surface: `Scroll`, `action`, `rows`.
//! Why this file: T4 asks for a scrollback viewport driven from the keyboard, and the host has
//!   two key sources now (AppKit, GTK) with a third coming. The DECISION - is this chord a
//!   scroll, and how far - is identical on every platform and is the part that can be wrong, so
//!   it lives here where a Mac can test it. The call sites are two lines each.
//! NOT responsible for: reading keys, or scrolling. `Session::scroll` owns the viewport and the
//!   pump clamps whatever it is handed, which is why `ToTop` can be a number rather than a query
//!   about how much history exists.
//! Test strategy: the chord table is asserted in BOTH directions - the chords that scroll, and
//!   the bare keys that must NOT, because those have to reach the child.
//!
//! WHY SHIFT AND NOT CTRL, which is a deviation from the plan's wording and is deliberate.
//! The plan asked for "cmd/ctrl+PageUp, Home, End". Cmd is honoured; ctrl is not, and the reason
//! is that ctrl+PageUp and ctrl+Home are REAL terminal sequences that programs consume -
//! `ESC[5;5~` and `ESC[1;5H`. A terminal that swallowed them would break tab switching in TUIs
//! and word-jumps in editors, and the breakage would look like the program's fault. Shift is
//! what every terminal on Linux claims for scrollback (GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Alacritty,
//! Ghostty's own `scroll_page_up` default), so it is the convention rather than a preference.
//!
//! Cmd is additionally claimed on macOS because nothing in a terminal sees cmd at all - it is
//! not a modifier the encoder can even express - so taking it steals nothing from anybody.
