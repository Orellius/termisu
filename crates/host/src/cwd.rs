//! Purpose: turn a raw OSC 7 report into a path the history store can key by.
//! Public surface (crate): `normalize`.
//! Why this file: the CORE stores the report exactly as the child sent it, and the oracle
//!   does the same -- decoding there would diverge on every path with a space in it. So
//!   the decoding has to happen somewhere above, and this is that somewhere: one place,
//!   unit-tested, rather than a percent-decode improvised in the view layer.
//! NOT responsible for: tracking the pwd (the core does), or deciding what to do with it
//!   (`suggest.rs` keys history by it).
//! Test strategy: the shapes real shells actually emit, plus the ones that would silently
//!   produce a wrong key.

/// The filesystem path a `file://` URI names, or `None` if it does not name one.
///
/// Accepts what shells really send: `file://host/path`, `file:///path` (empty host), and a
/// bare `/path` with no scheme at all -- OSC 9;9 and OSC 1337 report the last of those, and
/// the core stores every source in one field.
///
/// The HOST is discarded rather than validated. A remote host's path is not this machine's
/// path, but rejecting it would break every shell that reports its hostname (most of them),
/// and keying history by a directory that happens to share a name is a far smaller error
/// than having no history at all. Named here rather than left as a surprise.
