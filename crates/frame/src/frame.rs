//! Purpose: the reader's own copy of a frame, and the only shape a renderer is allowed to
//!   draw from -- runs, never a raw cell array.
//! Public surface: `Frame`, `FrameCursor`, `Run`, `Direction`, `cell_width`.
//! Why this file: this is the seam that keeps bidi out of the renderer, and slice 5.5 proved
//!   it holds. Reordering turned on by changing `runs` and `bidi.rs` alone -- the renderer
//!   was not touched, because it never assumed a direction and asks `Run::column_of` for
//!   every column it paints. A renderer that had added an index to a run's start instead
//!   would have compiled, passed every test before 5.5, and drawn Hebrew backwards after it.
//! NOT responsible for: the thread handoff (`seqlock.rs`), bit layout (`packed.rs`), or the
//!   reordering itself (`bidi.rs`).
//! Test strategy: run splitting is unit-tested below against hand-built rows; the frame's
//!   agreement with the core is tested end to end in `tests/publish.rs`; the layout is
//!   measured against 91,707 Unicode cases in `tests/bidi_conformance.rs`.
