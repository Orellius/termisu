//! Purpose: hand a whole frame from the parse thread to the renderer without either one
//!   waiting on the other.
//! Public surface: `channel`, `FrameWriter`, `FrameReader`, `Publish`, `ReadOutcome`,
//!   `CapacityExceeded`.
//! Why this file: a mutex here makes the two threads take turns, and the thread that loses
//!   is whichever one is not already running -- Ghostty hit exactly this and had to add a
//!   demand-and-handoff protocol on top of its render-state mutex (`../ruuah/src/renderer/
//!   State.zig`, `lockDemand`), because under sustained pty output the parse loop relocks
//!   faster than a sleeping renderer can be scheduled. A seqlock sidesteps the fairness
//!   question instead of solving it: the writer never blocks, and a reader that catches a
//!   publish in progress discards that frame and comes back.
//! NOT responsible for: bit layout (`packed.rs`), run building (`frame.rs`), or where the
//!   bytes came from (`publish.rs`, and the pty crate above it).
//! Test strategy: `tests/tearing.rs` runs both threads flat out against a frame carrying a
//!   self-consistency invariant, and proves the harness can fail by running the same load
//!   through a reader that ignores the counter.
//!
//! There is no `unsafe` here and no volatile trickery. The payload is `AtomicU64` read and
//! written `Relaxed`, which is defined behaviour under concurrent access -- the standard
//! library defines a data race as requiring a *non-atomic* access, so racing relaxed loads
//! are merely unordered, never undefined. The counter's `Acquire`/`Release` pair is what
//! turns a set of individually-atomic words into one consistent frame.
