//! Purpose: decide where each cell of a row is drawn, once right-to-left text is involved.
//! Public surface: `BaseDirection`, `VisualSpan`, `visual_spans`, `is_layout`.
//! Why this file: reordering must happen HERE and nowhere below. The core stays byte-exact
//!   against libghostty-vt, whose ABI has no bidi surface at all, so reordering in the core
//!   would make every RTL line diverge from the oracle by construction and delete the only
//!   correctness signal the project has. The renderer above never learns which way a run
//!   goes -- it asks `Run::column_of` -- so this file is the only thing slice 5.5 changes.
//! NOT responsible for: the UBA itself (`wezterm-bidi`, verified against the full Unicode
//!   suite -- see `tests/bidi_conformance.rs`), shaping, or drawing.
//! Test strategy: the algorithm is measured against 861,948 Unicode conformance cases in
//!   `tests/bidi_conformance.rs`. The terminal POLICY on top of it -- segment bounding and
//!   base direction -- is unit-tested below, because the Unicode suite has no opinion about
//!   either and cannot catch a wrong choice there.
