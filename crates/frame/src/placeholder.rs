//! Purpose: kitty's unicode placeholder addressing -- U+10EEEE cells that name an image,
//!   a row and a column through their colour and their combining marks.
//! Public surface: `PLACEHOLDER`, `VirtualRun`, `virtual_runs`.
//! Why this file: a placeholder image lives IN THE GRID rather than beside it, so it
//!   scrolls, reflows and gets erased exactly like text, for free. That is the deep fix
//!   for images drifting away from their cells -- v2 taught anchors to ride reflow, and
//!   this makes the question not arise.
//! Why here rather than in the core: the core stays pixel-ignorant and, more to the point,
//!   these cells are ORDINARY TEXT to it. Nothing is parsed at print time; the meaning is
//!   read off the published frame, which is also what keeps it out of the differential
//!   corpus's way (the oracle's ABI exposes no graphics at all).
//! Reference: `../ruuah/src/terminal/kitty/graphics_unicode.zig`, whose rules are ported
//!   here -- `IncompletePlacement::init` for the decode and `canAppend` for the run rules.
//! Test strategy: unit tests below; the pixel half lives in `render/tests/placeholder.rs`.

/// The codepoint kitty reserves for a placeholder cell.
