//! The blind spot slice 5 step 3 opens: nothing in this project could see a concurrency bug.
//!
//! A seqlock whose reader ignores the counter, or whose writer forgets to mark the publish
//! in flight, passes every single-threaded test ever written against it. So the harness comes
//! first, and it has to be shown capable of failing before it is allowed to certify anything:
//! `a_reader_that_ignores_the_counter_does_observe_torn_frames` runs the identical load
//! through a reader with the protocol removed and asserts it DOES catch the frame mid-write.
//! Without that control, the passing test below is indistinguishable from a test that cannot
//! fail.
//!
//! The invariant is self-consistency. Every cell of frame N carries N in its style slot and
//! every row stamp is N, so a frame assembled from two publishes disagrees with itself and
//! nothing else has to be known about it.
//!
//! `a_publish_landing_mid_copy_leaves_no_frame_claiming_to_be_valid` asserts a second and
//! different invariant, because self-consistency provably cannot see the bug it exists for:
//! an interrupted copy usually finishes with clean content wearing the wrong generation, and
//! every cell agrees with every other one. What that test asks instead is whether the frame
//! was TOUCHED, which a skipped read is not allowed to do without invalidating it.
