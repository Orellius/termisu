//! The bridge D2b's gesture stands on: a FRAME can answer the selection rules.
//!
//! `termisu_vt_core::selection` is gated differentially against libghostty-vt, but it reads
//! `termisu_vt_snapshot::Row` and a host holds a `Frame` of packed cells. Without this bridge the
//! host's only options were to reach the core's scrollback across a thread it does not own, or
//! to re-derive the word rules from packed cells - a second copy of a set of boundary
//! codepoints with no oracle behind it.
//!
//! So the question these cases ask is not "are the selection rules right" (the corpus owns
//! that) but "does a frame reproduce the grid faithfully enough for those rules to reach the
//! same answer they reach on the core's own rows". Every case here therefore runs the SAME
//! probe against BOTH shapes and demands they agree - which is what makes them able to fail.
//! A `viewport_rows` that returned blanks, transposed x and y, or dropped the wrap flags would
//! be caught by the disagreement rather than by an assertion someone had to predict.
