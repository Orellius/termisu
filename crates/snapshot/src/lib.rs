//! The observable state of a terminal, and the difference between two of them.
//!
//! This crate is the contract of the differential oracle: `termisu-vt-ghostty` and
//! `termisu-vt-core` both produce a [`Snapshot`], and [`diff`] is the only thing that
//! decides whether they agree. It holds no terminal logic and depends on
//! nothing, so neither implementation can bias the comparison.
