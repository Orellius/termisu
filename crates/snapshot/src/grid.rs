//! Purpose: the terminal state a differential test is allowed to observe.
//! Public surface: `Snapshot`, `Row`, `Cell`, `Cursor`, `Style`, `Color`, `Wide`,
//!   `Underline`, `Screen`, `Dirty`, `Damage`, `Semantic`, `RowSemantic`, and a `Display`
//!   impl that renders a snapshot for human eyes.
//! Why this file: both implementations must agree on what "the grid" *is* before they
//!   can be compared, so the shape lives in one place that neither of them owns.
//! NOT responsible for: parsing, mutation, comparison (see `difference.rs`), or storage
//!   layout of a real terminal. A `Cell` here is deliberately convenient, not compact.
//! Test strategy: exercised through `difference.rs` tests and the corpus integration run.
