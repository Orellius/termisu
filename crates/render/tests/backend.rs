//! The blind spot slice 7 opens: nothing could see a SECOND backend.
//!
//! Every pixel test in this project measures one renderer against itself -- `redraw.rs`
//! compares an incremental repaint with a full one, `caret.rs` compares a shown caret with a
//! hidden one. All of them stay green if the backend is uniformly wrong, because both sides
//! of every comparison come from the same code.
//!
//! A second backend breaks that. The atlas, the run-to-column mapping and the damage logic
//! are shared, so the only place a GPU can disagree with the CPU is in the four operations
//! behind `Surface` -- and the way it disagrees is by a unit or two per channel, which no
//! screenshot and no human will ever catch.
//!
//! So the requirement is byte equality, not a tolerance. That is affordable because the blend
//! is specified as integer arithmetic rather than left to the backend: any backend that does
//! `(source * alpha + destination * (255 - alpha) + 127) / 255` per channel lands on the same
//! bytes by construction, GPU or not.
//!
//! Proven able to fail by `a_backend_that_truncates_the_blend_is_caught`, which drops the
//! rounding term -- the exact mistake a shader that computes in floats and rounds toward zero
//! would make -- and is caught despite being off by at most one.
