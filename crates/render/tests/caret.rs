//! The blind spot slice 5.6 step 3 opens: nothing could see WHERE THE CARET LANDS.
//!
//! `tests/redraw.rs` proves an incremental repaint equals a full one, and it does so with the
//! caret painted either way -- the invariant holds whether the caret sits on the right cell or
//! the wrong one, because both renderers are consistently wrong. The bidi tests cover where
//! the TEXT goes and say nothing about the cursor.
//!
//! So on a reordered row the caret could sit on a glyph the program never addressed and every
//! existing test would pass. It looks entirely reasonable on screen too: the caret is on a
//! real character, just not that one.
//!
//! The caret is located by measurement rather than by comparing whole canvases: each row is
//! painted twice, once with the cursor visible and once hidden, and the columns whose pixels
//! differ are the columns the caret occupies. That answers "where is it" directly instead of
//! "is it the same as some other render", which was the first version of this file and was
//! wrong -- the caret redraws its own cell's glyph inside the block, so two carets at the same
//! column still differ pixel for pixel when they name different cells.
//!
//! `set_visual_caret_for_testing(false)` restores the old logical placement, and the
//! requirement is two-directional: the two must AGREE on Latin and DISAGREE on Hebrew. A
//! mapping that had quietly become the identity function would pass the first and fail the
//! second.
