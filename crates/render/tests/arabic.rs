//! The blind spot this file closes: nothing in the suite could see that an Arabic letter's
//! FORM depends on its neighbours.
//!
//! Every shaping test before this one uses Latin, where there is one form, or Hebrew, where
//! the isolated and contextual forms of a letter are the same glyph. So a renderer that draws
//! every Arabic letter in its isolated form -- which is exactly what this one did -- scored
//! perfectly on all of them, and the README explained the result away as a property of
//! terminal grids.
//!
//! The observable is positional and needs no reference image: **the three cells of a
//! three-letter Arabic word must not all look the same.** Drawn isolated they are three
//! copies of one glyph and are pixel-identical; drawn joined they are the initial, medial and
//! final forms and are three different glyphs. Measured on this machine at 32px, beh alone is
//! glyph 867 and the same letter in a word resolves to 870 / 869 / 868.
//!
//! **A pixel comparison here is not a clean measurement of form, and the tests say where they
//! stop.** The Arabic faces installed on this machine are proportional -- beh advances 22.4px
//! against a 19px cell -- so a glyph drawn at its cell's origin OVERHANGS to the right, and
//! whether that overhang survives depends on paint order: in a right-to-left run cells are
//! painted in logical order, which is right to left on screen, so each letter's overhang lands
//! on a cell already painted. Measured 2026-08-08: an empty space between two Arabic letters
//! carries 50 inked pixels that belong to its neighbour. That is a separate defect from
//! joining, it predates this file, and it is recorded in `docs/BACKLOG-2026.md` rather than
//! papered over here. The consequence for these tests is that FORM is asserted against glyph
//! ids, and pixels are used only where the comparison is between two cells that are equally
//! contaminated or equally clean.
//!
//! ## The mutants, including the ones that lived
//!
//! Killed:
//!
//! - forcing `Script::Latin` on the run: swash gates its joining state machine on the script,
//!   so all three letters collapse to the nominal glyph. Three tests red.
//! - letting the pen walk the font's advance across cells instead of restarting per cell: the
//!   glyph ids stay correct and the letters drift off the grid, so only the PIXEL test goes
//!   red. That split is why both a glyph-id test and a pixel test are here.
//! - removing the run-of-one refusal.
//! - removing BOTH lam-alef guards at once.
//!
//! Survived, recorded rather than quietly dropped, because each says something true:
//!
//! - removing EITHER lam-alef guard alone. The cluster-spans-a-cell test and the
//!   one-cluster-per-cell count are redundant: swash emits lam-alef as a single cluster
//!   covering both cells, which trips both. Neither is dead; either alone would still refuse.
//! - removing the `is_joined` gates, in the segmenter and in the shaper, against the whole
//!   render suite. **No output test can see them.** Latin shaped through the run path resolves
//!   to the same nominal glyphs at the same per-cell positions, because that path enables no
//!   features. They stay as a SCOPE and COST gate -- they keep every row of code off the
//!   string-building path and keep a future font's default-on features away from Latin -- and
//!   that is a claim about blast radius, not one this file proves.
//! - removing the segmenter's boundary entirely, so a segment spans the space in
//!   `a_space_breaks_the_join`. It still passes, because a space is joining type U and the
//!   SHAPER already gives its neighbours isolated forms. So that test guards swash's behaviour,
//!   not the segmenter's, and saying otherwise would be the kind of false credit this project
//!   spends its time hunting.
//! - the one-script and one-font segment boundaries cannot be exercised at all here. Measured
//!   2026-08-08 against the live font stack: Arabic and Persian resolve, and N'Ko, Syriac,
//!   Adlam, Thaana and Mongolian all resolve to nothing, so there is no second cursive script
//!   on this machine to mix into a run. The boundaries are correct and unproven, and they are
//!   kept because a glyph id means nothing outside the font it came from.
