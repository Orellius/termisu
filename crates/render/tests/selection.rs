//! The blind spot D2b opens: NOTHING in this renderer could see a selected cell.
//!
//! D2a built the selection model and gated it against libghostty-vt, so the RANGE and the
//! clipboard text are measured. None of that puts a pixel on screen. Until this file existed a
//! `draw_selection` that returned immediately - or tinted the wrong columns, or the wrong row,
//! or every row - passed `redraw.rs`, `caret.rs`, `vim.rs` and the whole corpus, because every
//! one of them either never sets a selection or compares two renders that are wrong the same
//! way.
//!
//! The measurement is positional and two-directional, in the shape `caret.rs` established:
//! paint the same frame twice, once with a selection and once without, and the columns whose
//! pixels differ ARE the highlighted columns. That answers "where is it" rather than "is it
//! the same as some other render", which is the question a whole-canvas comparison answers and
//! it is the wrong one.
