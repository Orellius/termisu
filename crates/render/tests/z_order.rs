//! The blind spot images-v3a opens: NOTHING COULD SEE DRAW ORDER.
//!
//! Every image test so far places one image, or places two that do not overlap, so a
//! renderer with the ordering reversed -- or with no ordering at all -- painted pixels
//! indistinguishable from a correct one. `image_clip.rs` is about geometry, `backend.rs`
//! about CPU/GPU agreement; neither can tell which of two images is on top, and none of
//! them can tell whether an image is over or under the text.
//!
//! So every assertion here is about OVERLAP. Two placements share cells and the question
//! is only which colour survives, which is the one thing a wrong layer order changes.
//!
//! The rules under test come from the oracle's renderer (`../ruuah/src/renderer/image.zig`,
//! the sort at line 359 and `bg_limit = i32::MIN / 2`): placements draw in `(z, image id)`
//! order, in three bands -- under the cell background, under the text, over everything.
