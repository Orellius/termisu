//! Purpose: turn one cell's grapheme cluster into positioned glyphs.
//! Public surface: `Shaper`, `PositionedGlyph`.
//! Why this file: a combining mark does not know where it goes. Hebrew niqqud carry no useful
//!   bearings of their own -- the font's GPOS table says where each one attaches to each base,
//!   and without consulting it a qamats lands wherever the glyph's default origin happens to
//!   be, which for Miriam Mono CLM is the left edge of the cell instead of centred under the
//!   letter. Measured: shaping moves it by half an advance.
//! NOT responsible for: reordering (that is `termisu-vt-frame`'s `bidi.rs`, and it happens per
//!   ROW), rasterization (`atlas.rs`), or font choice (`font.rs`).
//! Test strategy: `tests/shaping.rs` measures where the mark's ink actually lands, and proves
//!   the measurement can fail by running the same cell through the unshaped path.
//!
//! **One cell is shaped at a time, by default.** A terminal cell is addressable: the program
//! owns which column its text sits in, so shaping across cells would let the renderer merge
//! or re-space cells the program placed deliberately. REVISED 2026-07-30 for ligatures, on
//! the operator's order, with the guard that keeps the original property: `shape_run` shapes
//! a same-style ASCII segment with calt/liga, and the renderer takes the result ONLY when a
//! ligature actually formed (fewer glyphs than characters). A font without ligatures -- Menlo
//! -- therefore produces byte-identical output to the per-cell path, and Arabic joining
//! remains out (segments are ASCII by construction).
