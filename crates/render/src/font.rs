//! Purpose: turn a cluster of text into "which font, which glyph", and define the cell box.
//! Public surface: `FontStack`, `FontError`, `CellMetrics`, `Resolved`, `FaceStyle`.
//! Why this file: measured on this machine 2026-07-28 -- Menlo carries Latin and box drawing
//!   but maps Hebrew to glyph 0, and Arial Hebrew carries Hebrew but maps 'A' to glyph 0. No
//!   system font covers both, so a stack is not a refinement to add later; a single-font
//!   renderer cannot draw the thing this project exists to draw. That is why the atlas keys
//!   on (font, glyph) rather than glyph, and why resolution returns which font answered.
//! NOT responsible for: rasterization (`atlas.rs`), shaping. Shaping is slice 5.5 -- this
//!   maps ONE codepoint per lookup, which is correct for Latin and box drawing and is why
//!   Hebrew niqqud currently land as separate glyphs instead of stacking.
//! Test strategy: unit tests below pin the two coverage gaps that forced the stack, so a
//!   font change on the machine is caught rather than silently drawing tofu.
