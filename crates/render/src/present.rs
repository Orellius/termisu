//! Purpose: putting a rendered frame on a screen-shaped target without a readback.
//! Public surface: `Blitter`, `PresentError`.
//! Why this file: `gpu.rs` says a window, a swapchain and a surface format are the embedder's
//!   problem. This is the half of that problem which can be checked by a machine. A `Blitter`
//!   copies the pixel buffer straight into a render target on the GPU, so the frame reaches a
//!   screen without ever crossing to the CPU - today every drawn frame is copied back purely
//!   so AppKit can wrap it in a CGImage, 12.5 MB at 2240x1400.
//! NOT responsible for: owning a window, configuring a swapchain, or resizing one. Those need
//!   an OS window and can only be proven by looking at it; keeping them out of here is what
//!   lets the part that fails SILENTLY be tested headlessly.
//! Test strategy: `tests/present.rs` blits into an offscreen texture, reads it back, and
//!   requires byte equality with `read_pixels` on the same frame. The fixture is deliberately
//!   asymmetric in red versus blue, because a grey fixture cannot fail under a channel swap.
//!
//! **The sRGB trap is refused, not handled.** The pixel buffer already holds non-linear sRGB
//! bytes - that is what the CPU canvas produces and what the differential oracle pins. A render
//! target whose format reports `is_srgb()` would treat those bytes as LINEAR and gamma-encode
//! them again, which washes every colour out and looks like a design choice rather than a bug
//! (paid for on 2026-05-18 in another project; near-black rendered as medium grey). Rather than
//! silently compensating, `Blitter::new` REFUSES such a format. A caller that hands us one has
//! misconfigured its swapchain and needs to hear about it at construction, not at first light.
