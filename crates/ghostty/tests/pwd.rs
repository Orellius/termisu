//! Purpose: pin what libghostty-vt does with OSC 7 and the pwd it stores, measured rather
//!   than assumed.
//! Public surface: none, this is a test.
//! Why this file: the pwd is an ABI observable (`GHOSTTY_TERMINAL_DATA_PWD`), so unlike
//!   OSC 52 or OSC 8 it has a real oracle and the corpus can pin it. Before termisu-vt
//!   implements anything, the rules the corpus will encode are read off the library here --
//!   probe for WHAT, source for WHY, both discharged before a line of core is written.
//! NOT responsible for: termisu-vt's own behaviour, or any comparison between the two.
//! Test strategy: write the sequences a shell actually emits and read the pwd back through
//!   the same ABI getter the differential harness uses.
//!
//! Source read alongside these probes, 2026-07-31:
//! `../ruuah/src/terminal/stream_terminal.zig` `reportPwd` -- the payload is stored RAW,
//! never parsed or validated, truncated at 4096 bytes; and `../ruuah/src/terminal/
//! Terminal.zig` `setPwd` (empty clears) / `fullReset` (RIS clears).
