//! Purpose: prove the types termisu-vt PUBLISHES match the ones libghostty-vt publishes.
//! Public surface: none, this is a test.
//! Why this file: slice 6's claim is that a program compiled against `ghostty/vt/*.h` can
//!   link `libtermisu-vt.a` instead. That is a claim about byte layout, and it was previously
//!   supported only by the fact that a human transcribed the numbers carefully. Here they are
//!   checked against the real library's own `ghostty_type_json()` -- the same self-description
//!   `abi_layout.rs` uses to verify the bindings, applied to the other direction.
//! NOT responsible for: behaviour across the ABI, which is
//!   `crates/abi/tests/differential.rs`.
//! Test strategy: for every struct termisu-vt publishes, compare `size_of` and each
//!   `offset_of` against the JSON. A struct the library stops describing is a failure, not a
//!   silent skip -- otherwise the test evaporates the day the report changes shape.
//!
//! This test lives here rather than in `crates/abi` because only this crate links
//! libghostty-vt, and `termisu-vt-abi-types` deliberately depends on nothing so it can be
//! pulled in beside the oracle. Linking `termisu-vt-abi` itself here would collide: both
//! define `ghostty_terminal_new`.
