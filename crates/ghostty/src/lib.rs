//! The oracle: a real libghostty-vt terminal, read out as a `termisu_vt_snapshot::Snapshot`.
//!
//! Ghostty's terminal core is the reference implementation termisu-vt is measured against. It
//! is consumed through the same published C ABI that RUUAH's Swift app already links,
//! so agreement here is agreement with a shipping terminal, not with a model of one.
