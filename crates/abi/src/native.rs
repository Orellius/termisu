//! Purpose: the ABI under **our own name**, `termisu_vt_*`, declared by our own header.
//!
//! The library published two things until now and only one of them was ours. The symbols were
//! `ghostty_*`, and the header describing them was `vendor/include/ghostty/vt/*.h`, built out of a
//! Ghostty checkout - so a consumer linking this archive read somebody else's documentation to use
//! our code, and the archive announced itself with somebody else's name.
//!
//! Both surfaces ship now, and they are not alternatives:
//!
//! - **`termisu_vt_*`** is the one we own, and `include/termisu_vt.h` is our own declaration of it.
//!   New consumers link this.
//! - **`ghostty_*`** stays, because it is the thesis rather than a courtesy. This engine's
//!   correctness signal is a differential corpus run against the real `libghostty-vt`, and the
//!   claim that earns - that this archive can be swapped in behind something built for that ABI -
//!   is true only while the symbols an existing consumer looks up are still present. Removing them
//!   would not make the project more homegrown; it would delete the evidence that the homegrown
//!   part is correct.
//!
//! Every function here is a THIN forward with no logic of its own, and that is the whole design.
//! Two entry points into two copies of an implementation is how they drift, and no test would
//! catch it because each copy would be self-consistent. There is exactly one implementation, in
//! [`crate::exports`]; this module renames it and nothing else.
