//! The C ABI termisu-vt publishes, matching the subset of `libghostty-vt` the differential
//! harness verifies.
//!
//! This is the project's thesis made executable: a program compiled against
//! `ghostty/vt/*.h` can link `libtermisu-vt.a` instead of `libghostty-vt.a`, because the
//! symbols, the struct layouts and the behaviour all agree.
//!
//! **What is exported is a subset, and saying so is part of the claim.** libghostty-vt
//! exports 179 symbols; this exports the terminal-core readout the corpus actually verifies:
//! terminal lifecycle, grid references, and cell / row / style reads. Kitty graphics, key and
//! mouse encoding, selection, OSC parsing, SIMD and the formatters are NOT here. A consumer
//! using only the verified surface can swap libraries; one using the rest cannot.
