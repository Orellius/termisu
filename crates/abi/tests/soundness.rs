//! Purpose: prove the read entry points are actually reads, in the Rust-model sense.
//! Public surface: none, this is a test.
//! Why this file: the oracle's `ghostty_terminal_get` reads fields off the terminal and
//!   mutates nothing (`terminal.zig`, `getTyped`), and its grid refs die on the next
//!   *update*, not on the next read (`grid_ref.h`). A C consumer is therefore free to read
//!   from two threads at once, or to hold a ref across an interleaved read. The audit's
//!   findings 14 and 22 were both this port breaking that freedom: every read conjured
//!   `&mut Terminal` to lazily refresh a cached snapshot, so two concurrent readers were a
//!   data race and a ref held across a read was an aliasing violation.
//! NOT responsible for: what the reads return -- `differential.rs` owns that.
//! Test strategy: neither defect can fail deterministically in a native run; undefined
//!   behaviour usually looks like passing. The oracle that can say NO is Miri:
//!
//!       cargo +nightly miri test -p termisu-vt-abi --test soundness
//!
//!   Both tests were run under Miri against the pre-fix code and SEEN to fail there
//!   (a data race on the cached view, and a Stacked Borrows violation through the ref's
//!   node pointer). Natively they still assert the behavioural half: the reads succeed
//!   and agree.
