//! Purpose: load the corpus of byte streams, each with the verdict it is expected to get.
//! Public surface: `Case`, `Resize`, `Expectation`, `load`, `CorpusError`, `DEFAULT_CORPUS`.
//! Why this file: a harness that is never wrong about anything is not evidence. Declaring
//!   the expected verdict per case makes the harness itself testable -- if the stub starts
//!   agreeing with Ghostty on SGR, that is a corpus failure demanding an explanation.
//! NOT responsible for: running anything (`run.rs`) or comparing anything (`termisu-vt-snapshot`).
//! Test strategy: the corpus round-trip is covered by `tests/corpus.rs`, which loads the
//!   real file rather than a fixture.
