//! The differential oracle harness: one byte stream, two terminals, one verdict.

//! Slice 0 of termisu-vt is a gate on this crate working, not on any terminal being written.
//! If an identical stream can be pushed through libghostty-vt and through termisu-vt and the

//! signal. If it cannot, the project has no way to know it is right and should stop.
