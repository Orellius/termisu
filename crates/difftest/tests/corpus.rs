//! Purpose: prove the harness detects agreement AND disagreement, on the real corpus.
//! Public surface: none, this is a test.
//! Why this file: a harness that only ever reports DIFF has not been shown to detect
//!   agreement, and one that only ever reports MATCH has not been shown to detect
//!   disagreement. Slice 0 is not passed until both are demonstrated, so both are
//!   asserted here rather than left to a human reading the output.
//! NOT responsible for: the correctness of either terminal. It asserts the harness.
//! Test strategy: run every declared case and compare the verdict to its expectation.
