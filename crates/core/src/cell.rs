//! Purpose: the storage unit of the grid, fixed at 8 bytes with no per-cell allocation.
//! Public surface: `Cell`, `Wide`, `CellFlags`.
//! Why this file: the cell layout is the one decision the rest of the core cannot walk
//!   back. It is modelled on Ghostty's `packed struct(u64)` (`ruuah/src/terminal/page.zig`)
//!   and on the C ABI, which already exposes `GHOSTTY_CELL_DATA_STYLE_ID` as a `uint16_t` --
//!   so an interned style ID is inherited, not chosen. Inline colours would cost 3x here.
//! NOT responsible for: what a style ID means (`style.rs`), where continuation codepoints
//!   live (`grid.rs`), or page-internal offset allocation (deferred to slice 3).
//! Test strategy: the 8-byte guarantee is a compile-time assertion, not a hope.
