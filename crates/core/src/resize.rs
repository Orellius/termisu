//! Purpose: apply a new geometry to a screen -- the storage round-trip around a reflow.
//! Public surface: `apply`.
//! Why this file: `reflow.rs` is a pure transform over rows and knows nothing about where
//!   rows live. This is the half that does: it drains the scrollback and the active area
//!   into one sequence, reflows it, and splits the result back. That split is the whole
//!   reason the two halves are separate files -- the transform is worth testing without a
//!   `Screen`, and this part is worth reading without the transform in the way.
//! NOT responsible for: how a line re-splits or where the cursor lands within it
//!   (`reflow.rs`), or the scrollback budget (`history.rs` prunes on push).
//! Test strategy: the differential corpus. Every rule here was measured against
//!   libghostty-vt on 2026-07-28 and each has a corpus case named `reflow-*`.
