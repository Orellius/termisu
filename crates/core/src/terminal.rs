//! Purpose: drive two screen buffers from a byte stream, using `vte` as the parser.
//! Public surface: `Terminal::new`, `Terminal::write`, `Terminal::resize`,
//!   `Terminal::snapshot`.
//! Why this file: the plan is explicit that VT parsing is solved and must not be rewritten,
//!   so this is only the `Perform` side -- what each parsed action does. It is the
//!   imperative shell over a functional core: no I/O, no clock, fully deterministic.
//! NOT responsible for: parsing (`vte`), control-sequence dispatch (`dispatch.rs`), buffer
//!   operations (`screen.rs`, `grid.rs`), style decoding (`sgr.rs`), tabs (`tabs.rs`),
//!   scrollback (`history.rs`) or reflow (`reflow.rs`, `resize.rs`).
//! Test strategy: measured against libghostty-vt by the differential corpus rather than by
//!   restating expected cell contents here.
