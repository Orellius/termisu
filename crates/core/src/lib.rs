//! The termisu-vt terminal core: bytes in, grid mutations out.
//!
//! Pure and deterministic by construction -- no PTY, no GPU, no clock, no I/O. That split
//! is what makes headless CI and differential testing against libghostty-vt possible, and
//! Ghostty enforces the same one physically between `src/terminal/` and `src/renderer/`.
//!
//! Slices 1 through 4 cover echo, SGR, cursor movement, the autowrap phantom state,
//! scrolling and scroll regions, the alternate screen, tab stops, the erase / insert /
//! delete operations, paged scrollback, and reflow on resize. The differential corpus
//! records each remaining gap as a case expected to differ.
//!
//! Bidi is **not** a core concern and never becomes one -- it is a slice 5 renderer item.
//! The C ABI has no bidi surface, so reordering here would break drop-in
//! compatibility and make every RTL line diverge from the oracle by construction.
