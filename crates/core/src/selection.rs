//! Purpose: derive a selection range from a point, and format it as clipboard text.
//! Public surface: `select`, `format`, `Rules`; reached through `Terminal::select`.
//! Why this file: selection is the one observable in this core that is a QUERY rather than
//!   state. No byte stream produces it, so it hangs off the grid rather than off the parser,
//!   and keeping it out of `screen.rs` keeps the mutation path free of read-only logic.
//! NOT responsible for: tracking a live selection across writes, mouse gestures, or drawing
//!   a highlight. A selection here is a value derived on demand and immediately stale.
//! Test strategy: the differential corpus (`select-*` cases). Every rule below was read out
//!   of the oracle's own `Screen.zig` and then confirmed by measurement, never inferred from
//!   a header - the two disagree, and the header is the one that is wrong.
