//! Purpose: one screen buffer -- its grid, its cursor, its scroll region, and the VT
//!   operations that act on all three together.
//! Public surface: `Screen`, and the cursor / scroll / erase / insert-delete operations.
//! Why this file: a terminal has two of these (primary and alternate) and they are
//!   genuinely independent -- separate contents, separate cursors, separate margins. Making
//!   that a type instead of a pair of fields is what keeps alt-screen switching a swap.
//! NOT responsible for: parsing, mode state, tab stops, or which screen is active
//!   (`terminal.rs`). It does not know the other screen exists.
//! Test strategy: measured against libghostty-vt by the corpus; unit tests below cover the
//!   region arithmetic, where off-by-ones are cheapest to catch in isolation.
