//! Purpose: the answerback half of slice 9 -- DSR and DA queries produce reply BYTES,
//! queued here because the core does no I/O. The pump drains them to the pty; the seam
//! is `Terminal::take_replies`.
//! Reference, measured from the oracle's source 2026-07-30 (its ABI exposes no reply
//! surface, so source + unit tests gate this, the OSC 8 precedent):
//!   - DSR 5  -> `ESC[0n`                      (stream_handler.zig:795)
//!   - DSR 6  -> `ESC[{y+1};{x+1}R`, origin-relative under DECOM, saturating at the
//!               region top (stream_handler.zig:801; this core has no left margin)
//!   - DA1    -> `ESC[?62;22c`  vt220 conformance + ansi_color (device_attributes.zig)
//!   - DA2    -> `ESC[>1;0;0c`  vt220 device type, firmware 0, rom 0
//!   - DA3    -> `ESC P!|00000000 ESC \`  DECRPTUI, unit id 0
//! Why a separate queue from `events.rs`: replies are PROTOCOL, addressed to the child
//! and ordered against its input; events are UI requests addressed to the embedder.
//! Collapsing them would make the pump route every item by kind for no gain.
