# Builds the S6 panel document: web/dist/index.html, one self-contained file.
#
# ORPHANED 2026-08-08 (T6) AND LEFT STANDING DELIBERATELY. The only consumer of web/dist was
# the Swift host's WKWebView panel, and that host was deleted. Nothing in this repository reads
# the document any more - measured, not assumed: a grep for `web/dist` and `--web-dir` across
# every source, script and config finds this file and nothing else.
#
# It is not deleted here because T6's ask was the Swift host and its references, and web/ is a
# separate orphan rather than a reference to it. Deleting somebody's work as a side effect of a
# different task is how a diff stops being reviewable. It is a one-line decision when the maintainer wants
# it: either the Tauri chrome grows a diff panel and this becomes its source, or `git rm -r web`.
#
# Was: the one part of the toolchain needing something other than cargo, kept separate so a
# machine with no bun still built a complete app.
