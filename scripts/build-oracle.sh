# accepted the Xcode licence - so on a machine with Xcode installed and unlicensed the build
# reports 62 of 64 steps succeeded and exits 1 while `libghostty-vt.a` and every header sit
# correctly in the prefix. Measured 2026-08-11 restoring the oracle after the format.
#
# termisu needs `lib/libghostty-vt.a` and `include/` and NOTHING else: `crates/ghostty/build.rs`
# checks for exactly that archive and bindgen reads those headers. The xcframework is a Ghostty
# distribution artefact for Apple platforms and nothing here has ever consumed it.
#
# So the failure is captured rather than propagated, and the check below - which already existed -
# becomes the real gate. `set -e` is suspended only across this one command; a build that fails
# for any reason that MATTERS still fails, because it will not leave the archive behind.
