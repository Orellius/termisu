# Not part of `cargo test --workspace`, and that is deliberate: the test it runs is `#[ignore]`d
# because an automated suite must not start authenticated agent processes on somebody's machine
# every time it runs. This script is how it gets run on purpose, so the command lives in one
# place instead of in a paragraph somebody retypes.
#
# It starts one agent, waits for it to prove itself, and shuts it down. No prompt is ever sent, so
# nothing is spent.

# REPOINTED 2026-08-11: this named `-p termisu`, the Tauri app crate, which was deleted when the
# host went back to Swift. The test moved with `launch.rs` into the host crate and the script did
# not, so it had been failing at cargo's package lookup rather than running anything.
#
# The bare separator matters: everything after it goes to the TEST harness, not to cargo. Without
# it cargo reads the ignore flag as its own and refuses.
