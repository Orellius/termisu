# Builds the shipped artifact: libtermisu-vt.a, with the hyphen.
#
# Cargo cannot emit that name. A package called `libtermisu-vt` produces liblibtermisu_vt.a, and
# `[lib] name = "termisu-vt"` is a hard cargo error -- "library target names cannot contain
# hyphens". So the crate is named termisu_vt, cargo emits libtermisu_vt.a, and this renames it, so
# a consumer's link flag reads `-ltermisu-vt` and mirrors `-lghostty-vt` exactly.
#
# Also verifies the archive actually exports the ABI. A drop-in that silently stopped
# exporting a symbol would fail at the consumer's link step, which is the worst place to find
# out, and no cargo test can see it because the symbols only reach the archive at build time.

# TWO surfaces, and both are checked because each carries a different claim.
#
#   termisu_vt_*  is ours, declared by our own include/termisu_vt.h. Missing one means a consumer
#                who linked us by our own name gets an undefined symbol.
#   ghostty_*    is the drop-in claim the differential corpus earns. Missing one means this
#                archive can no longer stand in behind something built for that ABI, whatever
#                the tests say.
#
# They are the same functions: crates/abi/src/native.rs is a thin forward, so a mismatch in
# COUNT between the two lists below means somebody added an entry point to one surface only.
