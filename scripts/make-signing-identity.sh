# Creates the stable local code-signing identity Termisu is signed with. Run ONCE per machine.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `codesign -s -` (ad-hoc) makes the app's designated requirement a bare cdhash,
# which is a hash of the code, so every rebuild is a DIFFERENT APPLICATION to macOS. Everything
# that remembers an app by identity then grows a row per build: TCC's Privacy panes, Launchpad,
# login items, "open with". That is the duplicate-Termisu symptom, and no amount of cleaning up
# the duplicates fixes it, because the next build makes another one.
#
# A stable certificate makes the requirement `identifier "..." and certificate leaf = H"..."`,
# which does not move when the code does. One app, permanently.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. Not Developer ID, not notarization, not distribution. It is self-signed and
# costs nothing, and a downloaded copy is still refused by Gatekeeper - correct, because Termisu
# is a local driver tool until it is deliberately shipped. Locally built apps are not
# quarantined, so Gatekeeper never runs on this one.
#
# REVERSIBLE. Everything it adds is one certificate plus its key in the LOGIN keychain, named
# below. To undo: Keychain Access, search the name, delete both rows. Or:
#   security delete-certificate -c "Termisu Local Signing" ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
#
# It touches nothing in the System keychain and needs no sudo.
