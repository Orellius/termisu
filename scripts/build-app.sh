# forward. It shipped briefly as `build-swift-app.sh` while the Tauri host was still alive and
# took this name back the moment that host was deleted, because one product has one install path.

# Sign the assembled bundle. SwiftPM's binary arrives only LINKER-signed: Info.plist unbound, no
# sealed resources - and TCC identifies an app by its signature, so macOS SILENTLY denies
# Desktop/Documents/Downloads without ever showing the permission prompt (measured live
# 2026-07-30: "cannot cd into Desktop" inside the app). A real ad-hoc signature binds the plist
# and seals Resources, which is enough for TCC to attribute the app and prompt.
#
# A STABLE IDENTITY, AND THIS IS WHY IT IS NOT AD-HOC ANY MORE.
#
# `codesign -s -` makes the app's DESIGNATED REQUIREMENT a bare cdhash:
#
#   # designated => cdhash H"f0c23e67af5314117812a89791b1f076fa32f97f"
#
# The cdhash is a hash of the code, so EVERY REBUILD IS A DIFFERENT APPLICATION as far as macOS
# is concerned. Everything that remembers an app by identity then accumulates a row per build:
# TCC's Privacy panes, Launchpad, login items, "open with". Measured 2026-08-11, after the maintainer
# reported duplicate Termisu apps for the second time - the first time it was diagnosed as a
# LaunchServices staging-bundle registration, which was a real and different bug, fixed, and
# NOT this one. Two causes, same symptom; that is why the first fix did not end it.
#
# Signing with a stable certificate instead makes the requirement
#
#   identifier "com.orellius.termisu" and certificate leaf = H"<cert hash>"
#
# which does not move when the code does. One app, permanently, and TCC grants survive rebuilds
# so Screen Recording and friends stop needing to be re-granted.
#
# SELF-SIGNED, deliberately. This is NOT Developer ID and NOT notarization: it costs nothing,
# needs no Apple account, and a downloaded copy is still refused - which is correct, because
# Termisu is a local driver tool until the maintainer says it ships (his call, 2026-08-11). It fixes the
# LOCAL identity churn and claims nothing about distribution.
#
# Absent the identity the build still works, ad-hoc, with the consequence named out loud rather
# than a silent regression to the behaviour above. `scripts/make-signing-identity.sh` creates it.
