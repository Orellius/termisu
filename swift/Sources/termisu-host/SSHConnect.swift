// The full SSH connection form.
//
// The maintainer asked for this shape directly on 2026-08-14, over a narrower one-field proposal:
// "a + button in the sidebar plus modal for SSH full connection like every convenient
// software". It is his call and this is built to it.
//
// The design constraint that survived the debate is where the result GOES. Everything
// collected here is either handed straight to a child process or appended to
// `~/.ssh/config`. There is no app-side host store, so there is still exactly one
// inventory of machines and it is the one ssh already reads. A saved host appears in the
// sidebar on the next open because the parser reads the same file back.
//
// THERE IS NO PASSWORD FIELD. `ssh` accepts no password on its command line, so the field
// would have to be stored or piped into a pty, and both are worse than letting ssh prompt
// in the pane where the operator can see what is asking.
//
// The form is GUI seam and closes as `[untested - needs your eyes]` by the repo's own
// rule. What IS gated is the mapping from fields to `SSHConnection`, because a swapped
// pair there sends the port into the user field and nothing visibly breaks.
