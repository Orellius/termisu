//
// Thin ON PURPOSE. Every fact here comes from `termisu_agent_*` in the archive: which CLIs
// exist, which of them this machine has, and whether an argv is ours to send. Nothing in this
// file decides any of that.
//
// The one that matters is `screen`. An approval-bypassing flag (--yolo,
// --dangerously-skip-permissions, -a never) is the operator's to type and never ours to add,
// and the guard that enforces it lives in Rust. A Swift copy of that flag table would be a
// second place for the policy to disagree with itself, and the way it would disagree is by
// being out of date -- so this asks rather than knows. The spawn asks again inside the
// archive regardless of what happens here; this call exists so the UI can say WHY before the
// operator hits a wall.
