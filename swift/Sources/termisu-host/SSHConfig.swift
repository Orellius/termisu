// The machines this operator already told OpenSSH about.
//
// A terminal that can open a pane on a remote box does not need its own inventory of
// hosts, an account model, or a settings screen. `~/.ssh/config` is where that list
// already lives, it is already correct, and it is already the thing `ssh` itself obeys.
// So this reads it and offers what it finds. Nothing here is written back; the file is
// the operator's.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT READ: `IdentityFile`, and any other key material or
// credential-shaped value. It takes the alias and the three fields needed to DESCRIBE a
// row (HostName, User, Port) and nothing else. A key path in a palette subtitle is a
// secret on screen for no gain, and `ssh` resolves identities perfectly well without
// this file's help. The child is spawned as `ssh <alias>` precisely so that every
// resolution decision stays inside OpenSSH.
//
// This is a PRODUCT feature and it lives in the Swift host on purpose. The engine is a
// pure state machine and `crates/host` publishes a C ABI with an asserted export count;
// a host list carries no policy that could disagree with itself across two copies, so
// there is nothing to gain by pushing it down and an ABI surface to disturb by trying.
// The stated cost: a future Linux host would need its own parser rather than inheriting
// this one.
