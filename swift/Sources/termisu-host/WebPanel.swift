// The web panel seam: a WKWebView hosting a locally built React document, with a typed
// message in each direction and nothing else crossing between them.
//
// Why a webview at all, when the terminal itself is native down to the pixel: the panels
// this serves are documents, not grids. A diff with syntax colouring, a markdown preview,
// a settings form -- these are where AppKit costs days and a browser engine costs hours,
// and none of them is on the input-latency path. The rule that keeps this honest is that
// THE TERMINAL SURFACE NEVER ENTERS THE WEBVIEW: no terminal pixels, no keystrokes on
// their way to a pty, no frame data. The panel is a sibling of the grid, never a layer
// over it.
//
// Everything here is off unless `panels = true` in config.toml (termisu_config_panels).
